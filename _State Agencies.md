# Valuable Data, Per State Agency

This is a quick effort to list common state-level agencies, and the especially interesting-looking data that they often hold that could be made more valuable if rendered as machine-readable data (whether a bulk download or an API). These may be expanded into their own proposed data ecosystems later.

## Executive

* every agency and that agency's website URL
* the org chart
* the [bluebook](http://wikis.ala.org/godort/index.php/State_Blue_Books)
* board seats etc. that are open for applications

## Council of Governments

(aka "planning districts," aka "regional councils")

* councils, including geodata of their boundaries

## General Services

* forms
* policies
* real estate holdings
* surplus real estate and property
* fleet vehicles owned

## Board of Medicine

* licenses (specialty, practice, address, convictions, claims, etc.)

## Taxation

aka "Department of Revenue"

* forms

## Unclaimed Property

* unclaimed property (probably API-based and single-query-responsive, for security reasons)

## Social Services

* eldercare services
* daycare facilities

## Attorney General

## Agriculture

* inspections of regulated private facilities (grocery stores, dairies, etc.)

## Conservation

* conservation easements
* land enrolled in a land bank
